Implementation Summary
In this implementation, I developed the Master Agent and Resource Agent components for the Disaster Rescue Coordination System using Solace Agent Mesh (SAM). The Master Agent handles victim communication through three core modules: prioritizer.py which calculates priority scores (0-100) based on severity, victim count, injuries, and hazard conditions following the team's data contracts; location_utils.py which extracts and validates GPS coordinates and addresses from natural language input; and victim_chat.py which creates standardized victim reports in the exact format required for inter-agent communication. The Resource Agent manages equipment inventory through inventory.py which tracks 20 equipment types (medical supplies, rescue tools, and fire/flood equipment) with availability, reservation, and threshold alerting capabilities; and allocator.py which handles resource allocation to rescue missions with support for partial allocations and automatic team assignment. Both agents are configured via YAML files (master_agent.yaml and resource_agent.yaml) that define their LLM settings, system instructions, and tool integrations. All implementations strictly follow the data contracts specified in TEAM-COORDINATION-README.md, using uppercase enums (CRITICAL/MODERATE/STABLE), ISO 8601 timestamps, and standardized ID formats (V-{timestamp}, M-{timestamp}, REQ-{timestamp}) to ensure seamless integration with Person B's Rescue Agent and REST Gateway components.
